# Optimizer Benchmark [WIP, The rankings are not very accurate]

A benchmarking suite for evaluating and comparing **PyTorch optimization algorithms** on 2D mathematical functions.
This project uses **[pytorch_optimizer](https://github.com/kozistr/pytorch_optimizer)** and **Optuna** for hyperparameter tuning, and generates visualizations of optimizer trajectories across optimization test functions.

> [!WARNING]
> **Important Limitations**: These benchmark results are based on synthetic 2D functions and may not reflect real-world performance when training actual neural networks. The rankings should only be used as a reference, not as definitive guidance for choosing optimizers in practical applications.


## 🌶️ Features

* Benchmarks **most of the supported optimizers** in `pytorch_optimizer`.
* Hyperparameter search with **Optuna (TPE sampler)**.
* Visualization of optimization trajectories on:
  * Ackley
  * Cross-in-Tray
  * Drop-Wave
  * Eggholder
  * Griewank
  * Langermann
  * Lévy
  * Rastrigin
  * Rosenbrock
  * Schaffer 2
  * Shubert
  * Styblinski–Tang
* Configurable **search spaces**, **iteration counts**, **ignored optimizers** and... via `config.toml`.
* Saves results and plots for later analysis.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/AidinHamedi/ML-Optimizer-Benchmark.git
cd ML-Optimizer-Benchmark

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run the benchmark
python runner.py
```

The script will:

1. Load settings from `config.toml`.
2. Iterate through available optimizers.
3. Run hyperparameter tuning with Optuna.
4. Save results and visualizations under `./results/`.
